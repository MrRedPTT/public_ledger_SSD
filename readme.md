# About 

This is a project for Systems and Data Security class in the Masters of Cybersecurity

The [full assigment](./docs/assigment.pdf)

# To do:

## Secure Ledger

The secure ledger should be moduler and it must support PoW and Delegated Proof of Stake
- using proof-of-work[]
- proof-of-stake[3,9]

## P2P

Layer that gossips the necessary data to support the blockchain. Must include:
- must implemente S/Kademlkia [5]
- Resistance to Sybil and Eclipse attacks
- Implement trust mechanisms (PoS)

## Auction

Auction System capable of supporting sellers and buyers using a single attribute auction following English auctions
- Transactions should be saved in blockchain and be properly gossiped
- publisher/subscriber should be built on top of Kadmlia to support auctions [8]

## Fault injection
Fault Injection mechanism that allows to shutdown 1 or more nodes.
To be used during presentation to show resiliency of the system.
